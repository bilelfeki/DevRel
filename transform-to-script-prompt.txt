I will provide you with a document. Your task is to transform it into a YouTube video script.
Follow these rules when creating the script:

1. Structure the script as follows:

Hook (3–6 sentences): Grab attention fast with surprising facts, questions, or a bold promise.

Introduction: Explain what the video will cover and why it matters.

Main Content (Body): Break the document into clear sections or chapters using engaging storytelling, analogies, examples, and explanations.

Call to Action: Encourage viewers to like, comment, and subscribe, and offer next steps or recommendations.

Outro: Short and memorable ending line.

2. Tone & Style:

Conversational, engaging, easy to understand.

Avoid unnecessary complexity—explain ideas simply.

Write for listener retention, not for reading.

3. Script Requirements:

Use spoken-language sentences (natural and smooth).

Add scene suggestions and B-roll ideas in brackets [like this].

Include pacing cues like pauses (…) when appropriate.

Make it dynamic—no monotone academic talk.

4. Output Format:

Title for the video

Short description

Full script ready for voiceover

Key highlights or timestamps

When ready, ask me to paste the document, and then convert it using the format above.
